Using Kibana Overview

Kibana Metrics and Logs Orientation
Locate the two screens inside Kibana that you will use to visualize this traffic:


Metrics


Logs



These pages will show you the changes in data that we will create.
Logs:
Click on logs to view some general system logs coming from the web machines.

Notice that you can Stream logs live from the machines.

Metrics:
Next, click on Metrics on the left side.


Here we can see all machines that are sending back metrics.


The large squares represent the VMs. Click on one square.


Choose View metrics from the dropdown that appears.



Notice that you can see CPU and Memory usage here.

Custom Dashboards
Kibana can very effectively utilize dashboards. The only caveat is that you have to create your own.


A great free tutorial for creating a Kabana dashboard can be found here.


The official Elastic tutorial for creating a dashboard is here.



Searching in Kibana
Kibana also allows you to search logs and data directly.
